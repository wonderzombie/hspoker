### todo

*   organize Poker.hs. functions are all jumbled.
*   possibly break out a separate PokerUtil.hs.
*   consider refactoring getSuit into a `lookup`.

### maybe todo

*   tests probably need cleaning up refactoring in general, but my inexperience is working against me here. not sure what best practices are.
*   maybe hand-related tests should assert on the rank returned?
*   consider ending experiment with slavish use of `case`.
